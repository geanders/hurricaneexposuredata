# hurricaneexposuredata 0.1.0

* Add storms for 2016, 2017, and 2018. For these, we have storm tracks, storm winds, 
and flood and tornado events. These do not include storm rains, but we anticipate
adding rainfall for these storms in the future.
* Change to use storm tracks from IBTrACS database (except for wind radii, 
which come from HURDAT2).

# hurricaneexposuredata 0.0.2

* Finalized lists of authors, contributors, and funding support. 
* Finalized documentation for current data. 
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
