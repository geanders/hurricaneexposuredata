Description: Includes data on distance- and rain-based exposure to Atlantic
    basin tropical storms in United States counties. This package can be used in
    conjunction with the "hurricaneexposure" package to explore, map, and
    characterize exposure to tropical storms at the county leve. This work was
    supported in part by grants from the National Institute of Environmental
    Health Sciences (R00ES022631) and the National Science Foundation (1331399).
