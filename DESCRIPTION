Description: Includes data on distance-, rain-, and event-based exposure to 
    Atlantic-basin tropical storms in United States counties. This package can be used 
    in conjunction with the 'hurricaneexposure' package to explore, map, and
    characterize exposure to tropical storms at the county level. This work was
    supported in part by grants from the National Institute of Environmental
    Health Sciences (R00ES022631), the National Science Foundation (1331399),
    the Department of Energy (DE-FG02-08ER64644), and a NASA Applied Sciences 
    Program/Public Health Program Grant (NNX09AV81G).
